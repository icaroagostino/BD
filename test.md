a. It is always recommended to take with you all the documents, even if they are not listed in the flow and in the official forms. May possibly be required to confirm some information.

b. Always carry copies of the required documents, in some procedures you will need to leave copies.

c. This is not an official document of the University, only a manual prepared by researchers who have already performed this procedure.

### Step 0: Welcome Center and Mensa Card

As soon as you arrive in Bremen and go to the University you should go to the Welcome Center. Is a support center for foreign students, they will support international researchers and their families before and during their stay in Bremen.

### Step 1: City Registration

After your arrival get with the tenant of the property the **"Apartment confirmation"**. Is a document that confirms that you have a rental contract in Bremen. Probably the tenant will ask for your passport and a copy of the contract. 

After that, you must go to Bremen Service Universität (BSU) to get the **city registration**, there it will be easy to locate the registration service.

### Step 2: Bank Account

It will be important to open a German account, because several services (including university enrollment) will require an account from Germany. The closest bank to the university is **Sparkasse**, which has a branch inside the campus, near the university restaurant. You will make an appointment and come back a few days later. After the opening you can use the online account on the same day and the card will arrive a few days later by post.

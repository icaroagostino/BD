## Step by step

<span style="color:red">__*Important notes:*__</span>

a. It is always recommended to take with you all the documents, even if they are not listed in the flow and in the official forms. May possibly be required to confirm some information.

b. Always carry copies of the required documents, in some procedures you will need to leave copies.

c. This is not an official document of the University, only a manual prepared by researchers who have already performed this procedure.

### Step 0: Welcome Center and Mensa Card

As soon as you arrive in Bremen and go to the University you should go to the Welcome Center. It's a support center for foreign students, they will support international researchers and their families before and during their stay in Bremen.

You can register before you arrive in germany through the link: [Registration](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/research-alliance/welcome-center/registration-at-the-welcome-center-for-international-researchers/)

For lunch at the university you will need a Mensa card, for that you will only need the UFSC Enrollment (in english). Will be charged 10 euros (5 for the card and 5 for the first recharge). At the end of your period you can return the card and receive the value back.

### Step 1: City Registration

After your arrival get with the tenant of the property the **"Apartment confirmation"**. It's a document that confirms that you have a rental contract in Bremen. Probably the tenant will ask for your passport and a copy of the contract. 

After that, you must go to Bremen Service Universität (BSU) (in the first 3 days) to get the **city registration**, there it will be easy to locate the registration service.

- **Documents required:**

  - Apartment confirmation
  - Passport

  (unfortunately only in German)
  
### Step 2: Bank Account

It will be important to open a German account, because several services (including university enrollment) will require an account from Germany. The closest bank to the university is **Sparkasse**, which has a branch inside the campus, near the university restaurant. You will make an appointment and come back a few days later. After the opening you can use the online account on the same day and the card will arrive a few days later by post.

- **Documents required:**

  - Apartment confirmation
  - Invitation Letter
  - Enrollment (UFSC)
  - Scholarship Letter (Capes)
  
Obs.: You may be required to come back later and submit your Bremen university application to confirm your account as a university student.

### Step 3: Enrollment Uni Bremen

To do the enrollment you must go to the rectory and submit the completed form along with the other documents. After a few days you will receive a letter from the university and will have to pay a enrollment fee (approximately EUR 380), then you will receive a semester ticket card. This card allows you to take the bus and tram free of charge in the city of Bremen and neighbouring regions.

- **Documents required:**

  - Invitation Letter
  - Health insurance
  - Enrollment (UFSC)
  - Scholarship Letter (Capes)

- **Place:** Rektorat Uni Bremen -

<span style="color:red">__*Note 1:*__</span> The University of Bremen requires undergraduate students to contract public insurance, but this obligation does not apply to PhD students or visiting researchers. It may be necessary to get a statement declaring that you do not need to contract public insurance, if necessary you should go to TK - Techniker Krankenkasse and ask for this statement. **In our experience we suggest to get this document before starting the enrollment process and attach it to the other documents to avoid any problems.**

<span style="color:red">__*Note 2:*__</span> The enrollment in the University is not an mandatory requirement for visiting researchers, however it is commonly required in the process of obtaining the VISA (Residence permit). In case you do not enroll, it is important to emphasize in the VISA process that you are doing a work mission as a visiting researcher. **Therefore, as a general rule, it is recommended to enroll to obtain the visa easily, and use public transportation free of charge within the city and in the neighborhoods.**
  
### Step 4: VISA (Residence permit)

A residence visa is required for anyone staying in Germany for more than three months. You must go to the same location as the city registration, but you will need to complete the entire enrollment process and have the university card. Approximately EUR 100 will be charged.
